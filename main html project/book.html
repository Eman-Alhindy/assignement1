        is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the earlier film of the same name. 
        It is based on the belief of the pseudoscientific law of attraction, 
        which claims that thoughts can change a person's life directly.
        The book alleges energy as assurance of its effectiveness. 
        The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages. 
        Scientific claims made in the book have been rejected by a range of critics, 
        pointing out that the book has no scientific foundation

        What happens when fantasy is the only thing that seems real? Just a few months ago, 
        Tom Boyd was a multi-million-selling author living in LA, in love with a world-famous pianist. 
        But after a very public break-up he's shut himself away, suffering from total writer's block, 
        with only drink and drugs for company.

    <p style="background-color:rgb(180, 245, 100) ; font-size:18px;"><strong style="font-size:23px ;">Central Park</strong>
        Alice, a fierce and respected Parisian cop, 
        wakes up on a Central Park bench with no memory of the night before,
        handcuffed to a complete stranger—a musician named Gabriel.
        Disoriented, dazed, and with someone else’s blood on her shirt, Alice works furiously to reconnect the dots. 
        She remembers clubbing with her friends the night before on the Champs-Élysées. 
        Gabriel claims he was playing a gig in Dublin. Was she drugged? Kidnapped? 
        Why is the gun in her jacket pocket missing a bullet? And whose blood is on her clothes?
        Over the next twenty-four hours, Alice and Gabriel race across New York in search of answers, 
        stumbling upon a startling set of clues that point to a terrible adversary from the past. Alice must finally confront her memories of hunting the serial killer who took everything from her—a man she thought was dead, until now.
